# OpenWRT wan Keep alive (OWKA) scripts

Another fork of [mchsks's lte-keep-alive scripts](https://github.com/mchsk/openwrt-lte-keep-alive) for OpenWRT.

If for some reason your Internet connection crashes from time to time (buggy ISP's modem, unstable wifi, unstable wwan, unstable router) and a reboot of the network interfaces or the router itself solves the problem, this script is for you!

### Script functionality:
- Check whether the router has Internet access by pinging 2 privacy-preserving DNS servers: 9.9.9.9 ([Quad9](https://quad9.net/)) and 193.110.81.0 ([DNS0.EU](https://www.dns0.eu)).
- If the router is offline, restart all network interface (wan, lan and wifi) up to 5 time (with a 45sec wait in between).
- If restarting interface is not enough, reboot the router (with 3min wait to avoid boot loop).
- Event log (with auto-purge to avoid saturating router storage).
- Automatic installation script with prompts for the install folder, daemon name, DNS servers, and retry timings.
  

### Update compare to original and other forks:
- Internet connection integrity is based on pinging 2 dns servers to avoid false positives in the event of failure of one of them.
- Use of [ncat](https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata/ncat) package, a much more improved and recent implementation of netcat, instead of the default busybox netcat "compact" or the outdated netcat package.
- The script is launched by a service daemon (etc/inid.d) and can therefore be controlled from the LUCI GUI (Thanks to helplessheadless for this nice improvment).
- The installation script automatically installs the ncat package if required and also activates and starts the daemon service.
